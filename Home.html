                My name is Adam and I am working towards becoming a web
                developer. I was born in the United Kingdom, and emigrated to
                the United States back in 2010. I am interested in web
                development as it incorperate both technical and creative
                computing skills and it allows me to continuously challenge
                myself. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, listening to
                music, or watching youtube. I am a huge fan of Formula 1 and
                enjoy being a part of its community.

                    A hobby I developed over the past few years is music
                    production.I enjoy collaborating with others and creating
                    music together. I am part of two music groups known as Young
                    Horizons and Fiji Gang. While Young Horizons mainly produces
                    alternative chilled music, Fiji Gang is a hip-hop group.
