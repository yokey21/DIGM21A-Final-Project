                    My name is Adam and I am working towards becoming a web
                    developer. I was born in the United Kingdom, and emigrated
                    to the United States back in 2010. I am interested in web
                    development as it incorperate both technical and creative
                    computing skills and it allows me to continuously challenge
                    myself. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, listening
                    to music, or watching youtube. I am a huge fan of Formula 1
                    and enjoy being a part of its community.
